# Audience & Jobs to Be Done

## Primary Audience

**Jack** - Developer/homelab admin seeking single-user self-hosted identity management with Ory Kratos.

## Jobs to Be Done

### 1. Centralized Identity

| | |
|---|---|
| **When** | Managing multiple homelab services that need authentication |
| **I want to** | Have a single identity provider with GitHub social sign-in |
| **So that** | I can authenticate once and access all my services securely |

### 2. Infrastructure as Code

| | |
|---|---|
| **When** | Setting up or recovering my identity infrastructure |
| **I want to** | Deploy everything via Terraform and git-versioned configs |
| **So that** | Infrastructure is reproducible and changes are tracked |

### 3. Secure Access

| | |
|---|---|
| **When** | Accessing homelab services from anywhere |
| **I want to** | Have TLS-secured endpoints via Cloudflare Tunnel |
| **So that** | I don't expose services directly to the internet |
